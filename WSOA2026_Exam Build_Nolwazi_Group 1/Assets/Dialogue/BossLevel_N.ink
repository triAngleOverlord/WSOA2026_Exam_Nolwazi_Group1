Nolwazi manages to escape from the first guard but unfortunately bumps into another

Guard: (firmly) Stop right there! Nolwazi, you're under arrest for treason. You're not going anywhere.

Nolwazi: (panting, defiant) You have no idea what you're doing, guard. I'm not a traitor; I'm a seeker of truth and culture. You need to let me go. There are secrets the government is hiding from everyone, and I have the evidence to prove it.

Guard: (skeptical) Secrets? Evidence? You expect me to believe that after all you've done?
#speaker:2Guard #portrait:seriousGuard

Nolwazi: (pleading) Look, I didn't want to betray my country, but I had to escape to find the remains of our lost culture, the heritage they've suppressed for years. Our people deserve to know their true history, the richness of our past. I'm not the enemy here; I'm trying to reveal the enemy within our own government.

Guard: (uncertain) I've heard this kind of story before, Nolwazi. People like you make bold claims, but they never have the proof they promise.
#speaker:2Guard #portrait:neutralGuard

Nolwazi: (desperate) I do have the proof, right here! (She reaches into her bag and pulls out a fruit from Nigeria.) This is a fruit from Nigeria. Our country hasn't grown real food in years; everything is from labs, but this is real, from the earth, itâ€™s real. There are countries out there that grow these, you have to believe me.

Guard: (hesitant) I'm risking everything by even considering this.
#speaker:2Guard #portrait:seriousGuard

Nolwazi: (earnest) The truth, guard. The truth about the government's involvement in the suppression of our culture, the theft of our history, and the suffering they've caused to countless innocent people.

Guard: (thoughtful) If what you say is true, it could change everything. But how can I be sure I can trust you, Nolwazi?
#speaker:2Guard #portrait:seriousGuard

Nolwazi: (earnestly) I understand your skepticism, but the only way to find out is to let me go. You can't keep me locked up here without investigating the information I have. If I'm lying, you can bring me back to face the consequences. But if I'm telling the truth, you'll be a part of exposing the darkest secrets our government has held for so long.

Guard: Alright, I believe you, you may go. #speaker:2Guard #portrait: seriousGuard

Nolwazi: (relieved) Thank you, guard. This is for the greater good, for the truth, and for our people who deserve to know the reality of their history.
