[After the quest]


	I have collected the beads and put them together. I still donâ€™t feel or see anything.#speaker:1Nolwazi #portrait:neutralNolwazi


Maasai Elder (Kibwana):
	That is because you have not yet believed. Close your eyes, take my hand, and now feel.#speaker:2Kibwana #portrait:seriousKibwana


	(With trust in Maasai, Nolwazi closed her eyes and grasped his hand. As her world of sight faded, another realm opened before her. Visions began to unfold, revealing the tapestry of history, culture, and knowledge that had been concealed from her until now.)

	Nolwazi witnessed the village as it used to be, pulsating with life and tradition, and felt the heartbeat of Africa, echoing through time, revealing the rich tapestry of its past. Her journey, one of hardship and discovery, unfurled before her. The faces of those she had met, the stories she had heard, and the cultures she had encountered, they all danced in her mind's eye.

	As the visions wove together, an outline of Africa began to emerge, an intricate mosaic of memories, knowledge, and heritage. It was a testament to the importance of learning, history, and culture in shaping not only the continent but also her own identity.

	Overwhelmed by the profound experience, Nolwazi whispered in awe:


	"Oh my goodness. That was amazing."#speaker:1Nolwazi #portrait:neutralNolwazi
