Nolwazi: *laughs* Thank you so much, itâ€™s delicious. #speaker:2Nolwazi #potrait:happyNolwazi


Ologun: Of course, nah. Let me tell you my secret ingredient. You see my friend Emmanuel owns a fruit stall, he sells me the best lemons, I just sprinkle a little over the fish, it makes all the difference. 150N for a pack of 25 lemons, 6N each. #speaker:1Ologun #potrait:flirtyOlogun
