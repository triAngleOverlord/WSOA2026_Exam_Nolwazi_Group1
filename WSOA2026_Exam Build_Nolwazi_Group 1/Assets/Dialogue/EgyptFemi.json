He should give you 27 gold coins back. Go back to the little children running around and split the coins equally between them and they shall give you a beaded necklace back, bring that beaded necklace to me.","#","^speaker:2Femi ","/#","#","^potrait:angryFemi","/#","\n",{"->":"Bargain_Choice"},{"#f":1}],"Accept":["^Nolwazi: Fine.","#","^speaker:1Nolwazi ","/#","#","^potrait:neutralNolwazi","/#","\n","^Femi: Once I have all those things, only then will I give you the necklace back.","\n",{"->":"Next_Choice2"},"done",{"#f":1}],"Reject":["^Nolwazi: That is too much to ask for a necklace.","#","^speaker:1Nolwazi ","/#","#","^potrait:neutralNolwazi","/#","\n","^Femi: If you do not like it, then you can leave!","\n",{"->":"Bargain2_Choice"},{"#f":1}],"Reconsider":["^Nolwazi: Okay Fine, I will do it.","#","^speaker:1Nolwazi ","/#","#","^potrait:neutralNolwazi","/#","\n","^Femi: Good, once you have all those things, then I will give you the necklace.","\n",{"->":"Next_Choice2"},"done","done",{"#f":1}],"General":["^Nolwazi:Hello, I am Nolwazi.","#","^speaker:1Nolwazi ","/#","#","^potrait:neutralNolwazi","/#","\n","^Femi: I have no interest in whateveryou have to say.
